# csx730-libdis Library Disassembly Activity

### Getting Started

1. Form into **small groups of two or three** people. These instructions assume that at least one group 
   member is logged into the Nike. 

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `csx730-libdis`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1730/csx730-libdis.git
   ```

1. Change into the `csx730-libdis` directory that was just created and look around. There should be a
   couple different files already present.
   
### Activity Questions

This activityis open book, open notes, and asking your instructor questions is allowed. You may
find the assembly notes provided in recent lecture modules on eLC useful. If you use `gcc -S`
as a last resort, you are still expected to fully document the assembly. Your instructor
reserves the right to question you about the low-level and high-level functionality of a 
sequence of instructions in your submission.
